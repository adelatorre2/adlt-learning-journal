# adlt-learning-journal

🧠 A personal self-learning journal and knowledge vault for mathematics, statistics, economics, and coding.

This repository is not a polished portfolio—it's a living, organized archive of notes, resources, cheat sheets, and references that support my ongoing self-education and skill development.

---

## ✍️ Purpose

This repository functions as:
- A centralized space to store and revisit key learning material.
- A reference bank for revising econ/stats/math/coding topics.
- A behind-the-scenes complement to my project portfolio (work in progress).
- A space to experiment with and document learning workflows in R, Python, Stata, and more.
